	h2 What is the AWAP Project?

	p.
		<b>AWAP Project</b> is project which shows web developers how to make account system on their sites without using passwords. The <i>AWAP</i> abbreviation means <b></i>Authorization Without A Password</i></b>.

	p.
		Some popular online services, messengers and so on use authorization without a password - authorization with the user's phone number. When user enters their phone number on site, the site sends an SMS with one-time code. User enters the code and becomes authorized.

	p.
		Authorization with SMS code is really better than using regular passwords. Attacks like bruteforce or fishing become useless. It's possible sign in stranger account only if it's owner wants it.

	p.
		However sending SMS from a site is very expensive and small budget web projects can't use this way. There is the solve of that problem! - You can let your users use Android/iOS applications for generating <b>One Time Passcodes</b>. For example: <b>Google Authenticator</b>

	p.
		When the user uses an app like Google Authenticator, it scans QR Code that generated by the site. The app starts generate one time codes every 30 seconds. You can replace passwords to one time codes on your site.
